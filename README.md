MY FIRST WEBSITE!

Startup of The Year Landing Page

Overview:

I built this simple yet effective landing page to promote an upcoming startup event, using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The focus was on creating a clean, responsive layout with a modern look, leveraging Bootstrap’s grid system and styling for quick alignment and formatting.

How I Built It

HTML Structure:

I started by setting up a straightforward HTML structure with a container and row layout using Bootstrap’s classes. This helped me quickly achieve responsive alignment for elements and ensure they adjust well on various screen sizes.

Styling and Fonts:

I integrated Google Fonts (Montserrat) to give the page a sleek, professional feel. The header text is bold and centered to grab attention immediately.
For additional styling, I created a style.css file to refine and personalize the design, while keeping the overall structure flexible.

Responsive Design with Bootstrap:

By linking Bootstrap via a CDN, I avoided the need to manage local files and took advantage of Bootstrap’s utility classes for rapid layout adjustments.
I used Bootstrap’s button class for a call-to-action button, which links out to an external site. The button also includes a subtle hover effect for added interactivity.

Meta Tags for Mobile Compatibility:

I included viewport and charset meta tags to ensure the site is mobile-friendly and renders well on a variety of devices.

This project was a hands-on exercise in working with a minimal setup to deliver a focused, visually appealing, and functional landing page. It was a great introduction to using Bootstrap and designing with responsive principles in mind.
